  about: "<h2 class='section-title'>Studio</h2><div class='about-content'><p><b>UDBHAV</b> is an architecture design studio based in Patna, India.</p><p>As a team we portray the “IDEA” through no. of discussions, sketches, photographs, illustrations and physical models which leads the design to more appropriate level for our users.</p><h4>Design philosophy</h4><p>We believe architecture is a piece of art and it affects mankind directly. The way we see, the way we move, the way we work, all are guided by these manmade built environment. As a designer we intend to create a harmonious space through visual and tactile material, which feed both the mind and the soul. We are keen to create spaces which always elevate our spirit in all terms.</p><h4>Site and context</h4><p>Every site has their own identity, their own context. We always try to put their individuality to develop the strong sense of place, which we achieve by enhancing or transforming the existing site using different methodology.</p><h4>Order/ geometry</h4><p>We believe sense of serenity could be achieved through proper geometrical order. Scale, volume and proportion are the fundamental consideration in our work.</p><h4>Light</h4><p>“Architecture appears for the first time when the sunlight hits a wall. The sunlight did not know what it was before it hit a wall” (by Louis I. Kahn). We manipulate the light and the shadows against it to create a sensuous and beautiful space.</p><h4>Technology and sustainability</h4><p>We have great respect for contemporary technique as well as the ancient style of making. We always try to create juxtaposition between these modern and classical technique and create a better sensuality.</p></div>",

The house is an enclosed geometrical cubes as seen from outside but flooded and rendered with light at inside. Some frames are created to respond to the surrounding without losing privacy. Plants, flowers of different colours are chosen to break the rigidity of pure geometry. Rooms are placed according to the sun and the local climatic condition.
